Description: Generalized LassO applied to knot selection in multivariate B-splinE Regression (GLOBER) implements a novel approach for estimating functions in a multivariate nonparametric regression model based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines using the Generalized Lasso. For further details we refer the reader to the paper Savino, M. E. and LÃ©vy-Leduc, C. (2023), <arXiv:2306.00686>.
